# Update the loopmath fit

Refit on everything in the store, then show the results page. No question.

Use exactly the commands below. Flags and fields are in `reference.md` next to this file. Never run `--help`.

## 1. Fit

```sh
loopmath fit --json
```

Add options only when the user asked for them:
- "without the shipped data", "only my runs": `--no-prior`;
- "without RQ1" (or `e0`, `sweep`, `benchmark`, `shared`): `--without rq1`, repeatable.

A new fit replaces the one `recommend` and the pages read. Read `fit.id`, `fit.n_runs.user`, `fit.n_runs.prior`, `runs_by_source`, `options`, `seconds`, `dropped`.

If it exits 4 (another fit holds the lock), wait 30 seconds and run it once more. If `fit.n_runs.user` is 0 and the user expected runs, say so and suggest `loopmath-onboard` or `loopmath-import-runs`.

## 2. Show the results page

```sh
loopmath posterior --html
```

It prints the page path. Open it (`open PATH` on macOS, `xdg-open PATH` on Linux); if that fails, give the path.

When the user asked about one workflow, add `--workflow CFG` (a `cfg_` id from their runs or a recommendation). For one task type and repo, add `--type TYPE --repo REPO`.

## 3. Summary

End with at most 4 lines, then stop:

> Fit fit_20260924181210 in 3.4 s: 52 of your runs plus 1,469 shipped runs (options: none).
> Left out: 12 attempts without usable cost.
> Results page: /Users/me/.loopmath/views/posterior-20260924-181214.html

Name each option used, and each `dropped` reason with its count.
